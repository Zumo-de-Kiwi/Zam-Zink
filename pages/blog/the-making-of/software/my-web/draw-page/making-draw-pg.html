          <h2 class="p-header">Introduction</h2>
          <p class="paragraph bigger-p">
            This is the first main page I made, once I had finished the Home
            Page, the About Me Page and the Contact Page. The Drawing Page is
            simpler than the other two pages where I show my works, namely the
            Photo Page and the Design Page, because I feel that drawing and
            sketching should be easy tasks that one can carry out anywhere
            anytime with just a pen and a sheet of paper, without any
            unnecessary <code>filters</code> between one’s ideas and the paper.
          </p>

          <h2 class="p-header">WHY</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            When it comes to drawings and sketches, it is as if a
            <code>blank page</code> were waiting for you, and that’s why I wish
            to design this page as clean and neat as possible. On the other
            hand, I was thinking of adding some
            <span class="italic">organic touch</span>. When you hover on the
            navbar (<span class="light-text">navigation bar</span>) sections,
            you can see that everyone has their own unique drawing animation.
            The drawing line animations are inspired from
            <a

              target="_blank"

              class="nowrap"
              >Josh’s page</a
            >. However, while on his page you can see them in action only when
            you click on a specific section, on my page it is enough to hover on
            it.
          </p>

          <h2 class="p-header margin-top-10">HOW</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            This page is the first where I implemented
            <code><strong>smooth scrolling</strong></code> , which is extremely
            useful when you are on a given page and click any other section.
            Besides being more visually appealing than directly teletransporting
            to another part without any <code>transition</code>, it helps the
            user know the <code>relative</code> position of the next section and
            the previous one.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The <strong>drawing line</strong> <code>animation</code> of every
            section of the navbar, because of its unique line shape, causes each
            to have a different length, consequently having their unique
            <code>transition</code> time, which makes transitions easier. This
            compares to driving at different speeds according to whether the
            road is straight or you are bending some
            <span class="italic">curves</span>.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            This page is where I first tried a
            <strong>responsive navbar</strong> , meaning that while your desktop
            will <code>display</code> a normal top navbar, on your phone you
            will have a
            <a
              href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hamburger-menu.htm"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >hamburger menu</a
            >
            (<b>三</b>), and the sections will appear after clicking.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            It was by designing this page, that I really put into practice the
            different <strong>position properties</strong> that each element can
            have on a given page –
            <code>absolute, fixed, sticky and relative</code> – when programming
            on
            <a
              class="nowrap"
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              CSS</a
            >
            (<span class="light-text">Cascading Style Sheets</span>). Sometimes,
            in theory, it looks simpler and easier, but when you try to work
            with it, you realize you don’t understand it that much.
          </p>

          <h2 class="p-header margin-top-10">WHAT</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">
            On this page you will find sketches and drawings, mostly in the last
            five years.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            <strong class="scale13 t-a-center">1. Architecture</strong
            ><br />When I was a kid, I was most of the time doing
            architecture-related drawings, planning the inside of a home or its
            exterior design. I was also really into drawing futuristic trains
            that fly and have unexpectable features and gadgets inside.
            <br /><br />
            One time I thought I would also need to draw a really futuristic
            train station for my cutting-edge train. I started by designing a
            railway station; later on, I drew the streets around the station,
            and ended up with a city that spanned over 20 pages.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            <strong class="scale13 t-a-center">2. Dodo</strong><br />The dodo
            project came later. It originated in a bookstore, where I saw a
            drawing book of an artist who had drawn a cat every day. At the end
            of the year, he had produced 365 drawings of the same character from
            multiple angles, doing various activities. <br /><br />
            I thought I could make something similar with another animal, so I
            chose the dodo, one of the most emblematic extinct animals. I
            wondered what a dodo’s life would be like in our contemporary era.
            Then, I represented it in many body types, from multiple
            perspectives, complementary visual angles and using various drawing
            techniques, since I wished every drawing to be unique.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            <strong class="scale13 t-a-center">3. Random</strong><br />I am
            constantly searching for new ways of drawing and straining my
            creativity. Any new idea is always welcome, as it may end up
            developing into a vast project.
            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            <strong class="scale13 t-a-center">4. Noodles</strong><br />I am
            really into using noodles (lines) for drawing shapes. I started
            combining separate lines to draw when, as a kid, I used to draw
            mazes.

            <br />
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            <strong class="scale13 t-a-center">5. Sketch</strong><br />I don’t
            know why, but I am always fascinated by the same sketches.
            Sometimes, the final result is even more impressive than I had first
            imagined. I like to do sketches of multiple topics and for diverse
            purposes.
