1. CSS [image-rendering] is a filter that have: auto(bi/tri/linear), pixelated, crisp-edges(nearest-neighbor)(-webkit-optimize-contrast)

2. If you use background images a lot in your CSS, you can reduce the number of HTTP lookups needed by combining the images into one, known as an image sprite. Then you just apply the same image each time you need it for a background and adjust the x/y coordinates appropriately.

However, the fewer HTTP requests and single image caching can help reduce page-load time.
